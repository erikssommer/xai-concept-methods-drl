"""
Concepts for JEM differs from the static concepts in 'static_concepts.py' by being present iff the move made creates the concept.
Meaning the concept is not present in the previous state, but is present in the current state.
This is done so that the agent can get a reward WHEN it does a move that creates a concept.
